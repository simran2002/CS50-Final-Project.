          What is YOGA?

            Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India.
            The practice of yoga has been started back from pre-vedic Indian traditions;possibly in the Indus valley civilization around 3000 BCE.
            Yoga is a sanskrit noun derived from the sanskrit root yuj (युज्) "to attach, join, harness, yoke".In the context of yoga sutras, the word Yoga means Union.
            Yogasanas are great to strengthen and relax the body. Yoga is a 5,000-year-old Indian body of knowledge.
            Yoga is all about harmonizing the body with the mind and breath through the means of various breathing exercises, yogasanas and meditation.
            Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the West, following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century with his
            adaptation of yoga tradition, excluding asanas. Outside India, it has developed into a posture-based physical fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique.
            Yoga in Indian traditions, however, is more than physical exercise; it has a meditative and spiritual core.
            Someone who practices yoga or follows the yoga philosophy with a high level of commitment is called a yogi (may be applied to a man or a woman) or yogini (a woman).
