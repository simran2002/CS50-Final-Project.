                Hatha Yoga is a branch of Yoga that deals with the physical aspect of Yoga through asanas(poses). 'Hatha' means 'forceful' or 'strong'. Hatha Yoga is an umbrella term
                for many types of Yoga styles. Hatha Yoga is not sequential. Few asanas can be picked and performed irrespective of their order. Hatha Yoga is a "YOGA OF BALANCE".
                Its a great way to introduce to Yoga for a beginner.

            <p class="parasize marginb">
                Vinyasa means 'connection'. Unlike Hatha Yoga, there is a sequence of poses that are performed in a particular order. Example of Vinyasa Yoga is <b>SUN SALUTATIONS</b>
                or <b>SURYA NAMASKAR</b>. They are a series of poses strung together in a neat sequence which are supposed to be practised in a particular way. Vinyasa moves at a
                faster pace and requires greater breathing control than Hatha yoga. Rather than focusing on “getting into the posture” and then breathing, in Vinyasa Yoga, the aim
                is to keep the deep breathing and body consciousness consistent throughout all movements during the practice.

                Iyengar Yoga is a form of Hatha Yoga founded by <b>B.K.S Iyengar</b>. It emphasises on holding the pose for longer and to perfect the posture by correcting the
                minute aspects of each asana. It's great for people demanding more flexibility and good for people with injuries who want to take things slow.The style often
                makes use of props, such as belts, blocks, and blankets, as aids in performing the asanas. The props enable beginning students, the elderly, or those with physical
                limitations to perform the asanas correctly, minimising the risk of injury or strain. It differs from other styles of yoga in three ways: precision, sequence and use of props.

                Bikram Yoga is a system of hot yoga, a type of yoga as exercise, devised by Bikram Choudhury, that became popular in the early 1970s. Classes consist of a fixed sequence of 26
                postures, practised in a room heated to 105 °F (41 °C) with a humidity of 40%, intended to replicate the climate of India. The room is fitted with carpets and the walls are covered
                in mirrors; the instructor does not adjust the students, who are expected to adjust themselves. Bikram Yoga Beginning Series classes run for 90 minutes and always consist of 26
                postures, namely 24 asanas, one pranayama (breathing exercise), and one shatkarma (a purification) in a fixed sequence.

                Kundalini is the term for "a spiritual energy or life force located at the base of the spine", conceptualized as a coiled-up serpent. The practice of Kundalini yoga is supposed
                to arouse the sleeping Kundalini Shakti from its coiled base through the 6 chakras, and penetrate the 7th chakra, or crown.  It derives its name through a focus on awakening
                kundalini energy through regular practice of meditation.The practice of kriyas and meditations in Kundalini Yoga are designed to raise complete body awareness to prepare the body,
                nervous system, and mind to handle the energy of Kundalini rising.
